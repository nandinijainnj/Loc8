A Digital lost and Found Web Application.
Developed a full-stack web platform to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and reclaiming lost and  found items.
The system was built using PHP for backend logic, MySQL for database management, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive front-end interface. 
Designed with user-friendliness and administrative efficiency in mind, it enables structured item listings, secure user sessions, and a moderated claim workflow. 
Looking ahead, the platform is envisioned to scale with LLM-based auto-verification of item descriptions and computer vision for image matching, enabling smarter automation in the admin decision-making process and enhancing accuracy in item-owner matching.
